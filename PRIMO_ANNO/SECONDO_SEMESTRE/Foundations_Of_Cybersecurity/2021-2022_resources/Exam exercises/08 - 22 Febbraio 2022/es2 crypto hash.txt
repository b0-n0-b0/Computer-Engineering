Given the two protocols P1 and P2 with 
P1: E(k1, x||H(k2, x)), where E() is a symmetric cipher
P2: x, E(pubK, H(x)), where E() is an asymmetric cipher

state whether they, respectively, satisfy the following security services:
• confidentiality
• integrity
• non-repudiation 

SOLUTION 
========

Protocol P1
----------- 
Confidentiality: YES, guaranteed by the cipher
Integrity: YES, guaranteed by the hashing and cipher.
Non-repudiation: NO, both parties can claim the other party has created the message.

Protocol P2
-----------
Confidentiality: NO, message x is in the cleartext form.
Integrity: NO, an adversary can replace x with a message x' of his choice, compute the hash and the encryption.
Non-repudiation: NO, anybody can create the message.
