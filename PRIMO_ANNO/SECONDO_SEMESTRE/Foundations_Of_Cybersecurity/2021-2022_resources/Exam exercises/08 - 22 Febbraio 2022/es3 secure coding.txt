Find and explain the vulnerabilities of the following function.
Then, patch the vulnerabilities.
There can be zero, one, or more vulnerabilities.

unsigned int do_stuff(unsigned int a, unsigned int b){
    if(a+b>UINT_MAX)
        return 0;
    return a+b;
}

Solution
--------

The problem is wraparound.
The error condition is poorly written since if a+b will wrap-around, the if clause will never be true.
The following patch must be applied.

unsigned int do_stuff(unsigned int a, unsigned int b){
    if(a>UINT_MAX-b)
        return 0;
    return a+b;
}
