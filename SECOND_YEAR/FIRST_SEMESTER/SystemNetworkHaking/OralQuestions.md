# Questions SNH
## Lettieri:
- #### Attack on Heap: DL/Metadata exploitation
    - Heap alignment (16 bytes/word)
    - Chunk schema (draw)
    - What happen after the free (double linked list)
    - Vulnerability in DLMalloc
    - What the PREV_INUSE bit is used for, which chunk references (the above one)
    - Arbitrary write and its consequences
    - What can we do if the NX bit is not enabled on the heap
    - Boundary tags
- #### Others attack on Heap
    - Double free
    - Use after free (what happens?)
- #### Stack canaries
    - What are they, how are they used
    - Global copy, where is it (Thread control block)
    - Canary only above the %RIP or there is something else to protect (%RBP), are there metadata in the frame?
    - What can we do to protect the dim of the array against overflow (use fortify source)
    - What does fortify source does (puts the array immediately above the canary and move the local var above it)
- #### Format string
    - %s what does it do
    - From where the printf takes the arguments (32b from stack, 64b %rdi %rsi %rdx %rcx %r8, %r9 and then from stack)
    - How can we control what to take specifically (random access %m$x where m is a number)
    - How can an attacker control the format string/What happens if the buffer is in the stack
    - %x how to use it to our advantage
    - Example on how to use %x to defeat PIE
- #### Dynamic libraries
    - Why use them
    - What does the loader do
    - What is in the GOT, who builds it and who populates it
    - How can an attacker exploit it
    - What happen with lazy binding? What is it in the relative GOT entry
    - How can we exploit this? (GOT not write protected --> redirect code)
    - If there is full RELRO reading the GOT is still usefull? (yes, you can still leak address to defeat ASLR)
- #### ASLR and PIE
    - What are they
    - In ASLR how are things loaded what is random (load in blocks, base address is random)
    - What are the requirements to use ASLR 
    - Without ASLR is there something random (yes, dyn lib, .bss)
- #### RELRO
    - Difference between full and partial
    - Why does this difference exists
    - How the read only is done (`mprotect()` called by the dLoader)
- #### Pointer Guard
    - CFI wha is it, how does it work
    - What are forward/backward jmp
### CE section
- #### Containers
    - Security analysis, are they secure
    - Capabilities how are they implemented and how do they work
    - Namespace how do they work
    - In namespace does a process have now two pid? 
    - What does `charoot()`
- #### SymLink
    - What happens when we follow a symlink to a non existing file
- #### SUID
    - What are the SUID programs, why do attackers want to exploit them
    - Possible `umask()` bugs
- #### Kernel
    - Goals of kernel exploit
    - Return to userspace
    - Mitigation (SMEP & SMAP)
    - How to defeat SMEP (use ROP)

## Perazzo (CE only):
- #### Same origin policy
    - What is it and what does prevent
    - Is script loading allowed (yes)
    - Case of iframe, what is not allowed (external page cannot access embedded content like DOM)
    - What is CSP, how does it relate to SOP
- #### View state asp.net
    - Session implementation
    - Can an adversary modify it (not without knowing secret)
    - The adversary can still do something else, what (HMAC does not prevent replay)
- #### Captcha
    - What are they and how they used
    - How do they work
- #### Browser history
    - What goes there, how can it be exploited
- #### Session fixation attack
    - What is it and how does it work
    - How to prevent/mitigate
    - If the token is sent into the body, is it secure? (No, use httponly and secure flags)
    - How to use defense in dept to prevent it (session upgrade -> token change)
- #### SQL injection
    - What is the original sin (No input validation)
    - Make examples (SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='...' AND password = '...', with username = `Admin' -- `)
    - Black filters, can we defeat it, what if `--` is blacklisted
    - If the program does and escape of some chars like `'`, how can we attack it? (Encoding problem like GBK)
    - Input injection, how to exploit it and how to lear the struct of the query
- #### XSS
    - Types of XSS
    - how to do a XSS with the POST method
    - DOM based XSS, how does it work and how can it be exploited
- #### Authentication
    - Change password functionality, problems with frequent replace
    - Password correlation issue
    - What can we do to avoid password correlation
- #### Session handling
    - What are some good practice
    - How to ensure the security of the session token
    - What tech can I use to cipher it
    - MITM how can we prevent it
