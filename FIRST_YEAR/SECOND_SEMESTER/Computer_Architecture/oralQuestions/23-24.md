# Oral Questions 23/24

Some questions from the oral examination of the Computer Architecture course, academic year 2023/2024.

- software techniques to improve cache accesses
- what registry renaming is used for
- "test-and-set" implementation
- all types of hazards
- draw 2-way cache, and explain how a write operation is performed
- multithreading (fine-grained, etc...)
- TLB
- types of misses
- how to determine the ideal number of cache ways in a multiprocessor and multithreaded system
- why do we pay more attention to improving the execution time of we write instead of laws, when we write them there are fewer of them?
- conflict cache, with also the design of a cache
- how we balance the load in a multiprocessor system (both symmetric and asymmetric memory cases)
- in which cases do we empty the pipeline (he wanted to talk about branch predictor and speculative execution)
- how to reduce conflict misses
