1. Calculate the various stage (barrier in the circuit) Y1, Y2, Y3, Y4, Y5
2. Calculate the probability of the mesuraments 
    Version_A P(00)=P(01)=P(10)=P(11)=1/4
    Version_B P(00)=P(11)=1/2
3. Calculate the quantum vector after the mesurament of |11>
    [0 0 0 1] (is a column vector so translate it)
4. Calculate the matrix U given by the union of Rx and S (do the tensor product not the matrix multiplicantion !!!!!!)
