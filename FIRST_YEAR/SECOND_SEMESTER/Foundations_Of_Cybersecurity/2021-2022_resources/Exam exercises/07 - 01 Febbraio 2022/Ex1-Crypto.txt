EXERCISE 
--------
Alice and Bob maintain a trust relationship with Trent, a trusted third party, that materializes in the shared secret keys Ka and Kb. 
Design a protocol that makes it possible to establish a session key between Alice and Bob and that satisfies the following requirements:
i) the protocol guarantees perfect forward secrecy;
ii) the protocol is robust w.r.t. replay attacks;
iii) the protocol guarantees key authentication and key confirmation;
Assume that clocks are synchronized.



SOLUTION
--------
M1 A -> T: E(Ka, A||B||Ya||ta)
M2 T -> B: E(Kb, A||B||Ya||tt1)
M3 B -> T: E(Kb, B||A||Yb||tb)
M4 T -> A: E(Ka, B||A||Yb||tt2)
M5 A -> B: E(Ksess, A||B||ta1)
M6 B -> A: E(Ksess, B||A||tb1)

where Ya and Yb are DH public parameters newly generated for every execution instance of the protocol; tx is a timestamp generated by the principal X, Ksess is a DH ephemeral session key.
