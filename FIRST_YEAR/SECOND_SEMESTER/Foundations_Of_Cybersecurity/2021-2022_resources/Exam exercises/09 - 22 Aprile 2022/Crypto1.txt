In an electronic auction, bidder Bob casts his bid B encrypting it by means of auctioneer Alice’s public key pubKA. Let us assume that a bid is 32-bit unsigned. 

1) Argue whether the following protocols 1-6 below are practical and secure w.r.t. to a passive adversary who attempts to guess the bid B. A protocol is secure if the guessing attack requires at least 2^(80) steps. 

1. B → A: Bob, {Bob, B}pubKA
2. B → A: Bob,{Bob, B, H(B)}pubKA
3. B → A: Bob, {Bob, H(B)}pubkA
4. B → A: Bob, R, {Bob, R, B}pubKA
5. B → A: Bob,{Bob, R, B}pubKA
6. B → A: Bob,{Bob, K}pubKA, {Bob, B}K

In the protocols, {X}K denotes the encryption of X under key K, H() is a secure hash function whose output size is h-bit, R is an r-bit random number, and K is a k-bit random symmetric cryptographic key. R and K are generated dynamically at bidding time. 

Select parameters h, r and k so that secure protocols have at least 80-bit security level. 

2) Argue the case the bid B is not uniformly distributed but falls in the interval [B1, B2], with B1, B2 unsigned and B1 < B2.

SOLUTION

Part 1)

1. Insecure. The ciphertext is an oracle. O(2^(32)). 
2. Insecure. Same reasoning as case 1. Using a different hash function has no effect.
3. Insecure. In addition, this scheme is useless because the auctioner would have to guess the the 
   bid. CT is still an oracle. O(2^(32)). Changing hash function H() has no effect. 
4. Insecure. Same reasoning as 1 and 2 because R is sent in the clear and thus the guessing is still 
   only on B.
5. Secure. R must be at least on r >= 80 – 32 = 48 bit. 
6. Secure. The adversary has to guess the symmetric key K. Thus, in order to have a security level 
   of 80 bit, the encryption key K must be at least 80 bits. 

Part 2) In case B is in [B1, B2], assuming B2-B1 on p bit, p <= 32, then in protocol 5, R must be r >=  (80 – p) 
bits
