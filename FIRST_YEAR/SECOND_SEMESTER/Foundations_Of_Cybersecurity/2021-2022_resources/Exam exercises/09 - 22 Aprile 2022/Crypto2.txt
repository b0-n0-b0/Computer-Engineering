Consider the following methods for integrity protection with encryption. In both cases, the cipher E is a stream cipher.

Method 1. 
Let the ciphertext c be  computed as c = Ek(x||h(x)) where h() is a hash function, and || is the concatenation operator.

Show that, if the attacker knows the whole plaintext x, (s)he can replace x by an arbitrary x′ of his/her choice and compute c′ such that the receiver will verify the message correctly. Assume that x and x′ are of equal length. 

Will this attack work too if the encryption is done with a one-time pad?

Method 2.
Is the attack still applicable if the checksum is computed using a MAC: c = Ek1 (x||MACk2 (x)).


SOLUTION
--------
Method 1.
1.	The adversary knows x and therefore computes h(x);
2.	The adversary computes k from x and h(x);
3.	The adversary computes h(x’);
4.	The adversary computes c’ = Ek(x’||h(x’)).
This attack will work if the encryption is done with OTP too.
Method 2
The adversary does not know k2 and thus (s)he is not able to compute MACk2(x’).
