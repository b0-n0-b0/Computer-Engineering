EXERCISE 
One of your clients has developed a website for his e-commerce business.
He asks you to conduct a black-box penetration test on his platform, in particular the login page.
The login web page is fairly simple, it features only two forms with the label “Username” and “Password”.
Your client gives you your credentials, usr “Engineer” pwd “Computer”.
You try to insert “Engineer -- “ in your username, and a different password.
The login FAILS.
Is the login system safe against SQL injection?

SOLUTION
We are not sure that the login system is safe. 
We need to perform at least one more test.
Indeed, if the webpage makes the query under the form of
SELECT * FROM Users 
WHERE PwdHash=hash($pwd) and UName=’$Username’
the system would not be safe against a tautology attack.
The test is to insert in the username field “Engineer’ OR 1=1.
WARNING: inserting the tautology inside the password form would not work, since most often than not, the content of the password form will be hashed before being evaluated by the query.
